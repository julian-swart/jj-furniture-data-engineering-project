# Data Engineering & Science Project: JJ Furniture

This is both a data engineering and science project between Jon and Julian - two Data Scientist colleagues who want to learn more about the data modeling process. 
We decided to create a fake business named JJ Furniture and simulate the data.

Our goals: 
- create fake data sets that simulate a real furniture business
- build data intake pipelines using python and AWS
- become more familiar with git
- use the data we created to build some ML models
- create 2 blog posts showing our learnings and work
