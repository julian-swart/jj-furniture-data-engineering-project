# Data Engineering Project: JJ Furniture

This is a data engineering project between Jon and Julian - two Data Scientist colleagues who want to learn more about the data modeling process. 
We decided to create a fake business named JJ Furniture and simulate the data.

Our goals: 
- create fake data sets that simulate a real furniture business
- build pipelines that create a datawarehouse for analytics-ready/model-ready data that would used by a Customer Analytics/Data Science team
- become more familiar with git
